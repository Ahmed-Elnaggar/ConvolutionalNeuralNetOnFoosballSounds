The first column of labels.txt is the record number, followed by all the timestamps of foosball goals.
The file names are in the format ZOOM000x_y.mp3
Where x is the record number and yyy is Tr1/Tr2/TrLR

If the record number is the same then it the audio record of the same foosball game. I recorded the games using three mics, each of them placed at different locations around the foosball table.
Therefore Tr1/Tr2/TrLR are simply different tracks. Note that Tr1/Tr2 are mono and TrLR is stereo.

I have the original 44.1kHz 16-bit WAV files and some more unlabelled games but they have not been uploaded.
