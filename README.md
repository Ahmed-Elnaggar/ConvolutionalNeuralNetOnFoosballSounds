# Convolutional Neural Net to distinguish Foosball sounds from other noises

This is a CNN that distinguishes between the sounds of foosball goals and non-goals. Included is a pickled dataset ready for use, and also the original sound recordings and foosball goals timestamps if you want to try something different.

IPython notebook: `CNN on Foosball sounds.ipynb`

Trained CNN model using TensorFlow (version 0.8.0): `model.ckpt`

Pickled Pandas dataframe (version 0.18.0): `full_dataset_44100.pickle`
